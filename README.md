## Transgender Health Outcomes | Simon Mack

### Executive Summary
As a transgender person, equality in healthcare for transgender people is important to me. In this capstone project, I will clean and analyze the CDC’s 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey to determine which U.S. states or regions have the greatest health disparities between transgender and cisgender people as well as among transgender people of different demographics.

The dataset’s size and complexity will be a challenge. My assumptions going into this project are that there are significant health disparities between transgender and cisgender people, especially among trans women of color in the Midwestern and Southeastern United States, but I’m excited to see if the data will surprise me.


### Motivation
I’m a transgender person, and even with the privilege I have as a white, male-passing person, my experience navigating healthcare has been difficult. I want to gain insights on where health disparities exist between transgender and cisgender people (and among trans people of different demographics) to provide a path forward in bettering the health outcomes of transgender people in the U.S.


### Data Question
Which U.S. states or regions have the greatest health disparities between cisgender and transgender people? Are there further health disparities among transgender people of different gender identities, sexual orientations, and/or races/ethnicities in these areas?


### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
My MVP will be a Google Sheets presentation accompanied by a Tableau dashboard. The presentation will cover the data question, data sources, and provide any additional context needed. The dashboard will be made up of interactive visualizations that compare heath access and outcomes between transgender and cisgender patients at a national and state level.

The intended audience of this MVP is the GMLA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ Equality. The presentation and dashboard are intended to help them decide where to focus their efforts to ensure equality in healthcare for transgender individuals and healthcare professionals.

### Data Sources
My data is the CDC’s 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey, a survey that collected state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. More than 418,000 people were surveyed, including almost 1,000 transgender people.
- The data itself
- Column and value explanations


### Known Issues and Challenges
- This data is only available in .xpt format. However, I’ve already used SAS Universal Viewer to convert it to a .csv file.
- This file is large, so I anticipate slow processing times. When possible, I will subset the data to reduce wait times.
- For cleaning the data, I know I’ll need to:
  - Drop irrelevant columns from the dataset
  - For each column, replace numerical values with the corresponding survey answer
