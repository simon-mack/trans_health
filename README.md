# Health Disparities in Transgender People in the U.S. | Simon Mack

## Executive Summary
As a transgender person, equality in healthcare for transgender people is important to me. In this project, I cleaned and analyzed the CDC’s 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey to determine which U.S. regions have the greatest health disparities between transgender and cisgender people as well as where disparities exist among transgender people of different demographics. For the purposes of this project, I measured health disparity by the difference between the percent of transgender people with poor health and the percent of cisgender people with poor health.

My assumptions going into this project were that there are significant health disparities between transgender and cisgender people, especially among trans women of color in the Midwestern and Southeastern United States. I was right and wrong. You can see my findings below.


## Motivation
I’m a transgender person, and even with the privilege I have as a white, male-passing person, my experience navigating healthcare has been difficult. I want to gain insights on where health disparities exist between transgender and cisgender people (and among trans people of different demographics) to provide a path forward in bettering the health outcomes of transgender people in the U.S.


## Data Questions
Are there health disparities between transgender and cisgender people in the U.S.? If so, what regions have the greatest health disparities between transgender and cisgender people? Where are there Among transgender people, what demographics are most likely to have poor health? How might these disparities be reduced?


## Data Sources
My data is the CDC’s 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey, a survey that collected state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. More than 418,000 people were surveyed, including almost 1,000 transgender people.


## Intended Audience
The example intended audience of this analysis is the GMLA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ Equality. The presentation and dashboard are intended to help them decide where to focus their efforts to ensure equality in healthcare for transgender individuals and healthcare professionals.


## Methodology
1. Retrieved data and converted from XPT to CSV
2. Cleaned and categorized data in Python
3. Defined key measures
4. Calculated key measures in Python
5. Created interactive dashboard in Tableau, validating measures with Python throughout
6. Created Google Slides presentation to accompany the dashboard


## Findings

### Disparities Between Transgender and Cisgender People
- Trans people are more likely than cis people to have poor health in every U.S. region
- The greatest disparities between cis and trans people are in U.S. Territories (Puerto Rico and Guam) and in the Midwest
- The region with the least disparity is, surprisingly, the South

### Disparities Among Transgender People
- Trans people who didn't graduate high school, earn less than $15,000 annually, or are unable to work are the most likely to have poor health
- The age group with the poorest health is 54-65
- Another surprise: white, non-Hispanic trans people are more likely to have poor health than Hispanic trans people and/or trans people of color (though not by much)
- Trans people who identified themselves as gender nonconforming were almost twice more likely to have poor health than trans men, with trans women falling in the middle
- Straight trans people are less likely to have poor health than gay trans people, but are more likely to have poor health than bisexual trans people

### Potential Action Areas
- Transgender people are more likely than cisgender people to:
  - Not see a doctor because of cost in the past year*
  - Not have healthcare coverage*
  - Not have a personal doctor
  - Not have a routine checkup in the past year*

*Especially among trans people with poor health
